- consistent vs inconsistent systems
- Writing as an augmented matrices 
- Valid elementary row operations
- REF (Gaussian Elimination) - refer to [[RREF]]
- back substitution
- free variables
- Solution sets and their geometry
- Homogeneous systems (with a link to [[Special Subspaces]] (null space))
- Relate to [[Linear Independence]], [[Span]], and [[Basis]] with sec 2.3's examples
