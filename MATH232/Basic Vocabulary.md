**Vector:** An object possessing both magnitude (length) and direction. Geometrically, it's an arrow; algebraically, it's an ordered list of numbers.

**Scalar:** A quantity described by a single number (e.g., temperature, mass).

**Components:** The numbers in the ordered list that define a vector.

**$R^n$:** n-dimensional Euclidean space ($R^3$ is three dimensional space, like what we live in). Vectors in $R^n$ would have n components.
	<u>Important note:</u> $R^2$ is NOT a subset of $R^3$ because it is missing a component. This means that any vector from $R^n$ is exclusive to that Euclidean space.

**N-tuple:** The ordered list of numbers representing a vector or a point's coordinates.

See [[Matrix]] for its definition.
